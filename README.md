# ARM Assembly Code

Some cool implementations of functions written in ```ARM Assembly```. 

This repository involves solutions to common problems such as the ```isPalindrome``` and ```hexToASCII``` problems and a working implementation of how the ```frame pointer``` works. 

There is also a subroutine that writes to memory using input from the ```JTAG UART``` console.
